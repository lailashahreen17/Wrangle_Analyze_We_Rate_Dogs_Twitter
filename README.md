# Project Motivation
The goal of this project was to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations. We followed the CRISP-DM method to gather, asses, clean and analyse data to create final visualizations to convey the message of the story.
